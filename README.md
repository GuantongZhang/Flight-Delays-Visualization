# Flight Delays Visualization
This is a visualization about the delays of flights in the USA in 2015.

In 2015, among the approximately 5.8 million domestic flights in the US, 36 percent of them were delayed. In fact, the delays has correlation with month, origin and destination airport/state, and the airline. The fact/insight is that in June and December, the average delay time is longer, possibly due to the increasing number of tourists during the holidays. Also, the delay time of different airlines varies, from 0.96 minutes advance (Alaska Airlines) to 14.32 minutes delay (Spirit Air Lines). Moreover, some routes also have longer delay, such as from Chicago (ORD) to Denver (DEN), which delayed 17.89 minutes on average.
